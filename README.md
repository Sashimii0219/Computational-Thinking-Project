# Computational-Thinking-Project
The project's aim is to find the highest point on a given map by optimizing the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm, with 5 test maps being given to test out our code. The efficiency is determined by how many times the getHeight() function is called, while effectivness is basically how close the algorithm is to finding the highest point. My algorithm aims to iterate through the map in steps calculated by the size of the map to find a high point (Brute Force Search), then iteratively doing search for grids around the highest point so far to determine the next highest point. The algorithm will run until it hits the limit for the number of times it can call getHeight(), or until it is at the highest point possible.
